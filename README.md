LassoBlogger
============

An open-source blog engine for Lasso

LassoBlogger is based on Jussi Hirvi's partial port of WordPress 1.5 in 2005, and has since been developed by Jussi Hirvi, with some support and code (notably language files nl and sv) from the Lasso community.

Before this, LassoBlogger has been downloadable from LassoForge, with over 12000 downloads for the most popular version (0.7.0 in 2005). Since then, the code was for some time downloadable at code.google.com. 

Jussi Hirvi's <a href="http://www.greenspot.fi/LassoBlogger" target="_blank">dev blog</a> will most probably be phased out slowly... 

In lack of feedback, I currently develop LassoBlogger very slowly, and only in terms of my own needs. 

Contributions are welcome.
