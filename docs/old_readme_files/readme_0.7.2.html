Many things in this blogware are copied or adapted from the justly famous <A HREF="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</A> blogware (written in php). Big thanks to the WordPress team. </p><p style="text-align: right;">&#8212; Jussi Hirvi </p><h1 id="installation">Installation</h1><ol>	<li>Unpack the zip file in an empty directory</li>	<li>Open up <code>config-sample.lasso</code> with a text editor (on Windows, choose WordPad or similar) and fill in your database details (db name, username and password). Check the rest of the file, too (you can set your language preference etc.)</li>	<li>Save the file as <code>config.lasso</code> </li>	<li>Upload everything to your server.</li>	<li>Launch <span class="file"><a href="admin/install.lasso">/admin/install.lasso</a></span> in your browser. This should help you setup the database and tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your <span class="file">config.lasso</span> file, and try again. If it fails again, please read the <a href="http://www.greenspot.fi/LassoBlogger/">dev blog</a> or contact the developer - <b>don't</b> just give up! </li>	<li><strong>Note the password given to you by the install script.</strong></li>	<li> The install script should then send you to the <a href="admin/index.lasso">admin pages</a> for login. Sign in with the username <code>admin</code> and the password generated during the installation. You can then click on 'Users', etc., to change the password.</li></ol><h1 id="requirements">System Recommendations</h1><ul>    <li><strong>Lasso Professional 6</strong> or newer (may work on v5, but is not tested; I have developed this on L6.0.6); as for Lasso 7 and newer, some testing has been done, but <strong>not</strong> enough!</li>	<li><strong>MySQL 3.22</strong> or newer (or the embedded LassoMySQL), may even work on other SQL db's, but this is not tested</li></ul><h1 id="notes">User Levels </h1><p>The admin page "Edit users" helps you grade the levels. The theoretical levels range from 0 to 10, but essentially the relevant levels are:</p><ul>	<li>0 - Can edit his/her own user info</li>	<li>2 - Can post, edit, and delete his/her own posts</li>	<li>5 - May edit links and categories; sees list of users</li>	<li>8 - Admin - may edit options, and edit posts, comments and user info of all users</li>	<li>10 - Max value</li></ul><p>In the usual case you may want a team of level 2 users (writers) to work with you (the administrator). You may also want one or two assistant admins (level 8 would be good for that). </p><h1>New features in 0.7</h1><p>The two big new features are permalinks and language support. </p><p>When using permalinks, links to your post may look like <code>www.MyDomain.org/MyBlog/2005/12/My_Post_Title</code>.</p><p>Permalink structure can be modified by adjusting the related  option (new in this version) on the admin page Options > Permalinks. Permalinks use the "error.lasso method". This required that you put a <strong>modified error.lasso</strong> file to your domain root, where Lasso will use it in case of any errors. </p><p>Check the enclosed <code>error.lasso</code>. you can use it as such, or modify (for example, you could add link to webmaster, or company logo). Then put it to the domain root. </p><p>Of course, you can perfectly well use LassoBlogger without using permalinks. In that case links to your posts look like this: <code>www.MyDomain.org/MyBlog/?p=15</code>.  </p><p>The <strong>language support</strong> works this way: </p><ul>    <li>first try to find out if a language file for your language already exists; take a look to the <code>languages</code> folder; read the official <a href="http://www.greenspot.fi/LassoBlogger/">dev blog</a>; ask the developer    <li>if not, it's easy to do - about 70-80 phrases to translate from English, and they all are in one file; it took me about 30 minutes to do the Finnish translation (it's all in <code>languages/fi.inc</code>)</li>    <li>decide upon a language code (for example de, fr, or en_UK)</li>    <li>open <code>languages/language_template.inc</code> and follow directions in it</li>    <li>finally, activate your translations by changing the value of variable <code>lang</code> from "en" to your chosen code (in <code>config.lasso</code>)</li></ul><p>New in 0.7.0 is also the possibility to create <strong>static pages</strong>.</p><h1>Upgrading from older versions</h1><p>If you have an older version  of <strong>LassoBlogger</strong>, first</p><ul>    <li>save your existing <code>config.lasso</code> to a safe place (also other files, that you have possibley customized), </li>    <li>replace all the (other) <strong>LassoBlogger</strong> pages with the new versions</li>    <li>put your existing <code>config.lasso</code> back where it belongs, </li></ul><p>If you have version <strong>0.6</strong> or <strong>0.7.x</strong>, run <code>admin/upgrade_06_072.lasso</code>. </p><p>If you have version <strong>0.5</strong>, run first <code>admin/upgrade_05_06.lasso</code> and after that <code>admin/upgrade_06_072.lasso</code>. </p><p>If you have version <strong>0.5</strong> or <strong>0.6, also</strong>, open the new <code>config_sample.lasso</code>, scroll down, copy the last line (<code>Variable:'start'...</code>) and place it at the bottom of your active copy of <code>config.lasso</code>.</p><h1>Customising the layout</h1><p>This can be a little delicate. The basic style sheet is in <code>themes/default/style.css</code>. Now, in v0.7, I moved style definitions that affect the page header (the top of page, where you see blog name and description) from the stylesheet to the top of the html template, <code>gen/frame_default.inc</code>. You can adjust them to your liking, and on later upgrades be sure to backup and reuse your modified <code>frame_default.inc</code>. The stylesheet itself might be modified from version to version, though I try to be conservative about it. </p><p>Of course you can also revamp the stylesheet - that equals creating a new <b>theme</b>, and I'm interested to distribute LB themes. Besides a stylesheet, a theme can also include images. </p><h1>Future</h1><p>From now on the development will probably slow down or stop, except in case (you bet) bugs turn up. This is simply because I think I will now have a good enough platform to start my personal and/or project blog(s). </p><p>There are lots of things that would need doing. It would be great if you would collaborate. So far about five users have contacted me, and only three of them have helped in beta testing! That goes to show that the open source spirit (implying sharing and generosity) is not very much cherished among Lasso developers. Maybe we have had it too easy - always <strong>someone else</strong> is taking care of things. Maybe this could change? :-) </p><h1>Support and Documentation</h1><p>There is very little documentation besides this file. Check the <code>docs</code> folder for some basic lists and version history. For support, check the LassoBlogger dev blog first. There you can leave bug reports and ask questions. You can also contact the developer by email - see LassoForge for address. BTW, WordPress documentation (there is a lot of it) is in many respects valid for LassoBlogger, too.</p><h1>Thanks</h1><p>Thanks to Ian Blackford for beta testing (for v0.6), and Steve Piercy for testing & expert advice (for v0.5) concerning the install script. Doug Gentry afforded valuable feedback for v0.7.</p><h1>Copyright</h1><p>Let's say that <b>LassoBlogger</b> is released under the <abbr title="GNU Public License">GPL</abbr>.</p></body></html>
