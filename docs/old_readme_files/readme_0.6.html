Many things in this blogware are copied or adapted from the justly famous <A HREF="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</A> blogware (written in php). Big thanks to the WordPress team. </p><p style="text-align: right;">&#8212; Jussi Hirvi </p><h1 id="installation">Installation</h1><ol>	<li>Unpack the package in an empty directory</li>	<li>Open up <code>config-sample.lasso</code> with a text editor (on Windows, choose WordPad or similar) and fill in your database connection details</li>	<li>Save the file as <code>config.lasso</code> </li>	<li>Upload everything to your server.</li>	<li>Launch <span class="file"><a href="admin/install.lasso">/admin/install.lasso</a></span> in your browser. This should help you setup the database and tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your <span class="file">config.lasso</span> file, and try again. If it fails again, please read the <a href="http://www.greenspot.fi/LassoBlogger/">dev blog</a> or contact the developer - <b>don't</b> just give up! </li>	<li><strong>Note the password given to you by the install script.</strong></li>	<li> The install script should then send you to the <a href="admin/index.lasso">admin pages</a> for login. Sign in with the username <code>admin</code> and the password generated during the installation. You can then click on 'Users', etc., to change the password.</li></ol><h1 id="requirements">System Recommendations</h1><ul>    <li><strong>Lasso Professional 6</strong> or newer (may work on v5, but is not tested; I have developed this on L6.0.6); as for Lasso 7 and newer, some testing has been done, but <strong>not</strong> enough!</li>	<li><strong>MySQL 3.22</strong> or newer (or the embedded LassoMySQL), may even work on other SQL db's, but this is not tested</li></ul><h1 id="notes">User Levels </h1><p>The admin page "Edit users" helps you grade the levels. The theoretical levels range from 0 to 10, but essentially the relevant levels are:</p><ul>	<li>0 - Can edit his/her own user info</li>	<li>2 - Can post, edit, and delete his/her own posts</li>	<li>5 - May edit links and categories; sees list of users</li>	<li>8 - Admin - may edit options, and edit posts, comments and user info of all users</li>	<li>10 - Max value</li></ul><p>In the usual case you may want a team of level 2 users (writers) to work with you (the administrator). You may also want one or two assistant admins (level 8 would be good for that). </p><h1>New in 0.6:</h1><p>There is now a registration page for visitors. If you switch user registration on by adjusting the relevant option (on the admin page Options > General), a link to the register page will appear on the public blog pages. Newly registered users will by default get privileges according to a setting on the admin page Options > Write (possible values 0, 1 or 2).</p><p>Of the inactive options in v0.5, 11 new ones have now been activated. See the source code of <code>upgrade.lasso</code>, if you want to see a list of them.</p><h1> Final notes</h1><p>This blogware is considered <strong>beta</strong>, so don't be surprised, if you stumble on bugs or stupid things. When that happens, I really hope you pass the word - you can write a comment on the "official" <b>LassoBlogger</b> dev blog, or email me.</p><h1>Future</h1><p>I will probably continue doing things to this sw, as I start to use it for my own purposes. Most of the options, for example, are still inoperative, though you can see them and even edit them on the admin pages (the status of each option - if it works or not - is also stated there).  </p><p>I hope you would participate. When you find out that you miss some feature, why not build a patch and send it to me, so it could be shared to all the other users? Or at least tell me what seems to be missing. </p><p>There are lots of things that would need doing. It would be great if you would collaborate. The documentation is very bad, but I will try to provide as much information as possible, in the first place using the <b>LassoBlogger</b> dev blog. You can use that blog to ask questions.</p><h1>Upgrading from older versions</h1><p>If you have already installed an older version of <strong>LassoBlogger</strong>, you won't have to delete your existing blog database. Not now or on future releases. That's a promise. </p><p>If you have an older version of <strong>LassoBlogger</strong>, don't run the installer. Instead, </p><ul>    <li>save your existing <code>config.lasso</code> to a safe place, </li>    <li>replace all the (other) <strong>LassoBlogger</strong> pages with the new versions, </li>    <li>put your existing <code>config.lasso</code> back where it belongs, </li>    <li>load <code>admin/upgrade.lasso</code> to your browser - that should take care of your database upgrade. </li> </ul><h1>About the name</h1><p><b>LassoBlogger</b> doesn't sound very imaginative, does it? I could have thought out something more poetical, like Bloghead, or Blogjam, but I really don't think this blogware <i>is</i> very imaginative at the moment. It only tries to be a decent blog solution and not stumble too much. Maybe the solution will become more personal in the future, but I feel that it really depends on you more than me. The name may change then, too, like those American Indian names. </p><h1>Share the Love</h1><p>Enough said.</p><h1>Copyright</h1><p>Let's say that <b>LassoBlogger</b> is released under the <abbr title="GNU Public License">GPL</abbr>.</p></body></html>
