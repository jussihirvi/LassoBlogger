Many things in this blogware are copied or adapted from the justly famous <A HREF="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</A> blogware (written in php). Big thanks to the WordPress team. </p><p class="small" style="text-align: right;">&#8212; Jussi Hirvi </p><h1 id="installation">Installation (upgraders, please scroll down)</h1><ol>	<li>Unpack the zip file in your web directory</li>	<li>Open up <code>config-sample.lasso</code> with a text editor (on Windows, choose WordPad or similar) and fill in your database details (db name, username and password). Check the rest of the file, too (you can set your language preference etc.)</li>	<li>Save the file as <code>config.lasso</code> </li>	<li>Upload everything to your server.</li>	<li>Launch <span class="file"><a href="admin/install.lasso">/admin/install.lasso</a></span> in your browser. This should help you setup the database and tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your <span class="file">config.lasso</span> file, and try again. If it fails again, please read the <a href="http://www.greenspot.fi/LassoBlogger/">dev blog</a> or contact the developer - <b>don't</b> just give up! </li>	<li><strong>Note the password given to you by the install script.</strong></li>	<li> The install script should then show you a link to the <a href="admin/index.lasso">admin pages</a> for login. Sign in with the username <code>admin</code> and the password generated during the installation. You can then click on 'Users', etc., to change the password.</li></ol><h1>Upgrading from older versions</h1><p>If you have an older version  of <strong>LassoBlogger</strong>, first</p><ul>    <li>it's a good idea to duplicate your blog database first (it's easy to do in Lasso Admin), so you will have an easy-to-access backup of your blog data, so you will always be able to go back to a previous version in case something goes wrong with the upgrade</li>    <li>move the zip file next to your active blog directory and unpack it</li>    <li>copy your old <code>config.lasso</code> from your active blog directory to the new version</li>    <li>do the same to any other files that you may have customized (customization of the style definitions in <code>gen/frame_default.inc</code> is recommended)</li>    <li>rename your old blog directory, for example from <code>blog</code> to <code>blog_OLD</code> (you can delete it later, when you are sure you have resqued from it everything you need)</li>    <li>rename the new blog directory (the one you just unzipped) with the original name, for example <code>blog</code> (you should use the same name as before, otherwise your blog's www address will change)</li></ul><p>If you upgraded from <strong>0.5</strong>, run <code>admin/upgrade_05_06.lasso</code> and after that <code>admin/upgrade_06_073.lasso</code>. </p><p>If you upgraded from <strong>0.6</strong> or <strong>0.7.x</strong>, run <code>admin/upgrade_06_073.lasso</code>. </p><p>After running the upgraders, it is a good idea to hide them from malicious users.</p><p>If you upgraded from <strong>0.5</strong> or <strong>0.6, also</strong>, open the new <code>config_sample.lasso</code>, scroll down, copy the last line (<code>Variable:'start'...</code>) and place it at the bottom of your active copy of <code>config.lasso</code>.</p><h1 id="requirements">System Recommendations</h1><ul>    <li><strong>Lasso Professional 6</strong> or newer (may work on v5, but is not tested; I have developed this on L6.0.6); as for Lasso 7 and newer, some testing has been done, but <strong>not</strong> enough!</li>	<li><strong>MySQL 3.22</strong> or newer (or the embedded LassoMySQL), may even work on other SQL db's, but this is not tested</li></ul><h1>New in 0.7.3</h1><p>Options related to commenting have now been activated. You will find them on the admin page Options &gt; Discussion, except for <code>comment_registration</code>, which for historical reasons is on the page Options &gt; General.  </p><p>Now LassoBlogger should have at least elemental protection against spam comments. For an overview of how to control commenting, see the file <A HREF="docs/lb_commenting_options.txt">lb_commenting_options.txt</A> in the docs.</p><h1>New in 0.7.2</h1><p>Categories can now be sorted (newest-to-oldest, or vice versa). A new field <code>cat_sortorder</code> is created for this purpose by the upgrader script.</p><h1>New in 0.7</h1><p>The two big new features are permalinks and language support. </p><p>When using permalinks, links to your post may look like <code>www.MyDomain.org/MyBlog/2005/12/My_Post_Title</code>.</p><p>Permalink structure can be modified by adjusting the related  option (new in this version) on the admin page Options > Permalinks. Permalinks use the "error.lasso method". This required that you put a <strong>modified error.lasso</strong> file to your domain root, where Lasso will use it in case of any errors. </p><p>Check the enclosed <code>error.lasso</code>. you can use it as such, or modify (for example, you could add link to webmaster, or company logo). Then put it to the domain root. </p><p>Of course, you can perfectly well use LassoBlogger without using permalinks. In that case links to your posts look like this: <code>www.MyDomain.org/MyBlog/?p=15</code>.  </p><p>The <strong>language support</strong> works this way: </p><ul>    <li>first try to find out if a language file for your language already exists; take a look to the <code>languages</code> folder; read the official <a href="http://www.greenspot.fi/LassoBlogger/">dev blog</a>; ask the developer    <li>if not, it's easy to do - about 70-80 phrases to translate from English, and they all are in one file; it took me about 30 minutes to do the Finnish translation (it's all in <code>languages/fi.inc</code>)</li>    <li>decide upon a language code (for example de, fr, or en_UK)</li>    <li>open <code>languages/language_template.inc</code> and follow directions in it</li>    <li>finally, activate your translations by changing the value of variable <code>lang</code> from "en" to your chosen code (in <code>config.lasso</code>)</li></ul><p>New in 0.7.0 is also the possibility to create <strong>static pages</strong>.</p><h1>Fighting spam comments</h1><p>From version 0.7.3 there are a number of options available to regulate commenting. These should go a long way towards keeping the spammers away without making the good guests feel unwelcome.  </p><p>There are so many options that it's easy to get things mixed up. I recommend the following: </p><ul>    <li>start with all comments allowed (check your discussion options)</li>    <li>read <code>docs/lb_commenting_options.txt</code> to get an overview of available options, so you will be ready to act</li>    <li>if and when you get first spam comments, start tightening the rules; start from the least powerful options. Go as far as needed, until the spam stops but the good comments keep coming</li></ul><h1>Customising the layout</h1><p>This can be a little delicate. The basic style sheet is in <code>themes/default/style.css</code>. Now, in v0.7, I moved style definitions that affect the page header (the top of page, where you see blog name and description) from the stylesheet to the top of the html template, <code>gen/frame_default.inc</code>. You can adjust them to your liking, and on later upgrades be sure to backup and reuse your modified <code>frame_default.inc</code>. I might modify the stylesheet from version to version, though I try to be conservative about it. </p><p>Of course you can also revamp the stylesheet - that equals creating a new <b>theme</b>, and I'm interested to distribute LB themes. Besides a stylesheet, a theme can also include images. </p><h1>User Levels </h1><p>The admin page "Edit users" helps you grade the levels. The theoretical levels range from 0 to 10, but essentially the relevant levels are:</p><ul>	<li>0 - Can edit his/her own user info</li>	<li>1 - Can post, edit and delete drafts (posts that need administrator approval to get published)</li>	<li>2 - Can post, edit, and delete his/her own posts</li>	<li>5 - May edit links and categories; sees list of users</li>	<li>8 - Admin - may edit options, and edit posts, comments and user info of all users</li>	<li>10 - Max value</li></ul><p>In the usual case you may want a team of level 2 users (writers) to work with you (the administrator). You may also want one or two assistant admins (level 8 would be good for that). </p><h1>Future</h1><p>The development will probably be slow now. I hope that you inform me, if you encounter bugs, or if you cannot find your favorite feature. </p><p>There are lots of things that would need doing. It would be great if you would collaborate. So far less than ten users have contacted me, and less than five of them have helped in beta testing! That goes to show that the open source spirit (implying sharing and generosity) is not very much cherished among Lasso developers. Maybe we have had it too easy - always <strong>someone else</strong> is taking care of things. Maybe this could change? :-) </p><h1>Support and Documentation</h1><p>There is not very much documentation besides this file. Check the <code>docs</code> folder for some basic lists and a rudimentary <A href="docs/versionhistory.html">version history</A>. For support, check the <A href="http://www.greenspot.fi/LassoBlogger/">LassoBlogger dev blog</A> first. There you can leave bug reports and ask questions. You can also contact the developer by email - see <A href="http://www.lassoforge.com">LassoForge</A> for address. BTW, <A HREF="http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page">WordPress documentation</A> (there is a lot of it) is in many respects valid for LassoBlogger, too.</p><h1>Thanks</h1><p class="small">Thanks to Ian Blackford for beta testing (for v0.6 and v0.7.3), and Steve Piercy for testing & expert advice (for v0.5) concerning the install script. Doug Gentry afforded valuable feedback for v0.7 and helped betatest v0.7.3. Thanks to everybody that I may have forgot to mention here - let me know, and I will gladly give you credit. Thanks to <A href="http://www.omnipilot.com">OmniPilot</A> for impressive work with Lasso, and to the Lasso developer community for really being a community. </p><h1>Copyright</h1><p class="small">Let's say that <b>LassoBlogger</b> is released under the <abbr title="GNU Public License">GPL</abbr>.</p></body></html>
