I find it hard to believe this project has come this far. </p><p>I started this, because I need a blogware, and don't know php well enough to feel comfortable with using php software. Many things in this blogware are copied or adapted from the justly famous <A HREF="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</A> blogware (written in php). I want to thank them very much and hope they don't mind. Probably not - I guess that's what open source is about. </p><p style="text-align: right;">&#8212; Jussi Hirvi </p><h1 id="installation">Installation</h1><ol>	<li>Unpack the package in an empty directory</li>	<li>Open up <code>config-sample.lasso</code> with a text editor (on Windows, choose WordPad or similar) and fill in your database connection details</li>	<li>Save the file as <code>config.lasso</code> </li>	<li>Upload everything to your server.</li>	<li>Launch <span class="file"><a href="admin/install.lasso">/admin/install.lasso</a></span> in your browser. This should setup the tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your <span class="file">config.lasso</span> file, and try again. If it fails again, please read the <a href="http://www.greenspot.fi/LassoBlogger/">dev blog</a> (though now it's still empty) or contact the developer - I hope you don't just give up. </li>	<li><strong>Note the password given to you.</strong></li>	<li> The install script should then send you to the <a href="admin/index.lasso">admin pages</a> for login. Sign in with the username <code>admin</code> and the password generated during the installation. You can then click on 'Users', etc., to change the password.</li></ol><h1 id="requirements">System Recommendations</h1><ul>	<li>Lasso version <strong>6</strong> or higher (may work on v5, but is not tested; I have developed it on L6.0.6, and "strict syntax" was off)</li>	<li>MySQL, may even work on other SQL db's, but is not tested</li></ul><h1 id="notes">User Levels </h1><p>The user level scheme may be a bit coarse at this stage. The admin page "Edit users" helps you grade the levels. The theoretical levels range from 0 to 10, but essentially the relevant levels are:</p><ul>	<li>0 - Can edit his/her own user info</li>	<li>2 - Can post, edit, and delete his/her own posts</li>	<li>5 - May edit links and categories; sees list of users</li>	<li>8 - Admin - may edit options, and edit posts, comments and user info of all users</li>	<li>10 - Max value</li></ul><p>In the usual case you may want a team of level 2 users (writers) except for you. You may also want one or two assistant admins (level 8 would be good for that). </p><p>There is no registration page as yet for visitors.</p><h1> Final notes</h1><p>This blogware is considered <strong>beta</strong>, so don't be surprised, if you stumble on bugs or stupid things. When that happens, I really hope you pass the word - at the moment this means emailing me (manager of the project at LassoForge), or writing a comment on the "official" <b>LassoBlogger</b> dev blog. </p><h1>Future</h1><p>I will probably continue doing things to this sw, as I start to use it for my own purposes. Most of the options, for example, are now inoperative, though you can see them and edit them on the admin pages (the status of each option - in use or not - is also stated there).  </p><p>I hope you would do the same. When you find out you miss some feature, why not build a patch, and send it to me, so it could be shared to all the other users. ... Or at least tell me what seems to be missing. </p><p>There are lots of things that would need doing. It would be great if you would collaborate. The documentation is very bad, but I will try to provide as much information as possible, in the first place using the <b>LassoBlogger</b> dev blog.</p><h1>About the name</h1><p><b>LassoBlogger</b> doesn't sound very imaginative, does it? I could have thought out something more poetical, like Bloghead, or Blogjam, but I really don't think this blogware <i>is</i> very imaginative at the moment. It only tries to be a decent blog solution and not stumble too much. Maybe it will become more personal in the future, but I feel that really depends on you more than me. The name may change then, too, like those Indian names. </p><h1>Share the Love</h1><p>I hope this thing will find many users. If you like it, I hope you will help make it better. </p><h1>Copyright</h1><p>Let's say that <b>LassoBlogger</b> is released under the <abbr title="GNU Public License">GPL</abbr>.</p></body></html>
