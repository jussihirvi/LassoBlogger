    <h1>LassoBlogger version history</h1>

    <!--
    <h2>Newest changes (published at GoogleCode, unpublished at LassoForge)</h2>
    -->
    <h2>0.9.2 (released 2012-04-07)</h2>
    <li>NEW FEATURE: Lasso 9 compatibility
    <li>NEW FEATURE: images can be scaled and/or rotated when uploading
    <li>NEW FEATURE: admin area redesigned, has new and faster navigation
    <li>NEW FEATURE: CKEditor instead of FCKEditor in admin area
    <li>REDESIGN: code has been thoroughly modernized; a lot of it has been refactored, some features have been rewritten; the code footprint is radically smaller than before
    <li>REDESIGN: permalinks are now set to use Apache rewrite (and similar) instead of "Lasso error" method, which was always flaky and which I could not get to work with Lasso 9 at all (no harm done)
    <li>BUGFIX: a lot of bugs have been fixed, and new ones created, no doubt
    <h2>0.9.1 (released 2009-06-19)</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>NEW FEATURE: New spam-filtering feature, based on an encrypted timestamp on the commenting form. Affected file: inc/module_comments.inc, cont/com-posted.inc (2009-06-19) 
    <li>NEW FEATURE: possibility to manually tie an uploaded file to a post (on the page Uploads > Manage Files). Affected file: admin/upl-fileedit.lasso. (2009-05-29) 
    <li>BUG FIX: When a left- or right-aligned pic was added to a post, and the pic was higher than the accompanying text, the pic pushed aside even the next post below. This has now been fixed (in style.css). (2009-05-25) 
    </li>
    <li>NEW FEATURE: FCKeditor (v2.6.4) integrated in LassoBlogger. Notes for use:
    <ul>
    <li>to enable FCKeditor for a field, open the stub file (for example admin/man-postedit.lasso), find the variable EditFields, and replace "textarea" with "textarea_fckeditor" in the third slot of the array 
    <li>if you get errors, check the Apache conf to verify that Lasso is *not* processing all files in the fckeditor directory; for example add these lines: <br />
	<blockquote>
	&lt;Directory "/var/www/MyPathTo/LassoBlogger/admin/fckeditor"&gt;<br />
	RemoveHandler lasso8-handler html htm js php pl py css<br />
	&lt;/Directory&gt;
	</blockquote>
    </ul>
    (2009-05-07)
    </li>
    <li>BUG FIX: On add or update action, the added or updated content appeared on the search form. This is now corrected. (2009-05-05) 
    </li>
    <li>NEW FEATURE: Possibility to make a post-related image into a link that points to another blog file (typically a high-res version of the same image) (2008-10-27). Directions of use: 
	<ol>
	<li>Upload a post-related pic (the small pic) in the usual way (Manage > Write & Edit Posts)
	<li>Upload the other file (the big pic) using the admin section Uploads
	<li>In Uploads > Manage Files, set the Image Display for the big pic as "none"
	<li>In Uploads > Manage Files, select the small pic, and set the Link URI so that it points to the big pic; also check the Description, which will become the title parameter of the a tag
	</ol>
    </ul>
    <h2>0.9.0 (released 2008-07-28)</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>LAYOUT: Comment list (displayed after a post) now neater. Affected files inc/module_comments.inc, themes/default/stylesheet.css. (July 23 2008)
    <li>BUG FIX: Registration form data, if sent, was being processed even when registration was prevented in blog options. This is now fixed. (July 23 2008)</li>
    <li>STYLESHEET: The default stylesheet (themes/default/style.css) has been completely restructured, for greater clarity. (July 3 2008)</li>
    <li>HTML: The column layout in the basic html frame is no more based on floating divs, but table cells (to ensure that the sidebar always stays on the side of the main column). Affected file: cont/index.inc. (July 3 2008)</li>
    <li>ADMIN: The central admin page "monster file" (gen/adminpage_monster.inc) has been restructured. Now it's less muddy. A short help section is now included at the top of the file. This operation may have caused bugs on the admin pages. (July 3 2008)</li>

    <li>NEW FEATURE: Graphical smilies now work (July 1 2008)</li>

    <li>NEW FEATURE: Login/Logout links now visible (when appropriate) in the narrow column (March 20 2008)</li>

	<li>BUG FIX: File upload gave a syntax error in Lasso 8.5 (but was ok in Lasso 6). As a fix, RegExp pattern corrected in /gen/adminpage_monster.inc, line 625.  (June. 11 2007)</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>0.8.0b1</h2>
    <ul>
	<li><b>File uploads</b></li>
	<li>Options are regrouped</li>
	<li>New option "multiuser_blog" (doesn't work yet)</li>
	<li><i>Small changes</i></li>
	<li>Option permalink_structure marked "works" in admin/install_stuff.inc (it was already ok in the admin/upgrade_06_073.lasso)</li>
	<li>Permalinks now work in "Special page" links (in sidebar)</li>
	<li>Unaccepted comments or those marked as spam don't show in rss feeds anymore</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>0.7.3 (released 2006-04-21)</h2>
    <p>About ten new options activated to give control over commenting and specifically protection against spam comments. See readme.html for more details.</p>
    <p>Fixed a bug that prevented permalinks to function, whenever the post title had non-ascii characters. </p>
    <p>Many other bug fixes.</p>

    <h2>0.7.2 (bugfix, not officially released)</h2>
    <p>- sorting of posts can now be defined in category settings: either newest-first or oldest-first</p>

    <h2>0.7.1 (bugfix, released 2005-12-20)</h2>
    <p>In admin/install.lasso added Var:'fromMetoRoot' = '../';</p>
<h2>New features in 0.7 (released  2005-12-19)</h2>
<p>The two big new features are permalinks and language support. </p>
<p>When using permalinks, links to your post may look like <code>www.MyDomain.org/MyBlog/2005/12/My_Post_Title</code>.</p>
<p>Permalink structure can be modified by adjusting the related  option (new in this version) on the admin page Options > Permalinks. Permalinks use the "error.lasso method". This required that you put a <strong>modified error.lasso</strong> file to your domain root, where Lasso will use it in case of any errors. </p>
<p>Check the enclosed <code>error.lasso</code>. you can use it as such, or modify (for example, you could add link to webmaster, or company logo). Then put it to the domain root. </p>
<p>Of course, you can perfectly well use LassoBlogger without using permalinks. In that case links to your posts look like this: <code>www.MyDomain.org/MyBlog/?p=15</code>.  </p>
<p>The <strong>language support</strong> works this way: </p>
<ul>
    <li>first try to find out if a language file for your language already exists; take a look to the <code>languages</code> folder; read the official <a href="http://www.greenspot.fi/LassoBlogger/">dev blog</a>; ask the developer
    <li>if not, it's easy to do - about 70-80 phrases to translate from English, and they all are in one file; it took me about 30 minutes to do the Finnish translation (it's all in <code>languages/fi.inc</code>)</li>
    <li>decide upon a language code (for example de, fr, or en_UK)</li>
    <li>open <code>languages/language_template.inc</code> and follow directions in it</li>
    <li>finally, activate your translations by changing the value of variable <code>lang</code> from "en" to your chosen code (in <code>config.lasso</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>New in 0.7.0 is also the possibility to create <strong>static pages</strong>.
</p>
    <h2>0.6 (released 2005-12-02)</h2>
<p>There is now a registration page for visitors. If you switch user registration on by adjusting the relevant option (on the admin page Options > General), a link to the register page will appear on the public blog pages. Newly registered users will by default get privileges according to a setting on the admin page Options > Write (possible values 0, 1 or 2).</p>
<p>Of the inactive options in v0.5, 11 new ones have now been activated. See the source code of <code>upgrade_05_06.lasso</code>, if you want to see a list of them.</p>
    <h2>0.5 (released 2005-09-06)</h2>
