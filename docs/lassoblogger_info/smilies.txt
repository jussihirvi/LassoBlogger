== How to use smilies (June 15 2008) ==

Smilies work since version 0.9.0 (July 2008). 

A list of smilies, with the respective text strings can be found in inc/module_posts.inc. Open the file and search for "smilies". 

The system can be easily expanded, if you want to add your own special smilies. Just modify the code block in inc/module_posts, and add/modify the jpg files in the smilies directory. 

There is an on/off switch for graphical smilies in Options > Writing.
