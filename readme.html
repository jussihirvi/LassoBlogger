If you want to see older versions, see <a href="http://www.lassoforge.com/projects.lasso?PR=64" target="_blank">LassoForge</a>.</p><h1>Installation (upgraders, please scroll down)</h1><ol>	<li>Unpack the zip file in your web directory</li>	<li>Open up <code>config-sample.lasso</code> with a text editor (on Windows, use WordPad or similar) and fill in your database details (db name, username and password). Check the rest of the file, too (you can set your language preference etc.)</li>	<li>Save the file as <code>config.lasso</code> </li>	<li>Launch <span class="file"><a href="admin/install.lasso">/admin/install.lasso</a></span> in your browser and follow it's directions. This should help you setup the database and tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double-check your <span class="file">config.lasso</span> file, and try again. If it fails again, please read the <a href="http://www.greenspot.fi/LassoBlogger/">dev blog</a> or contact the developer - <b>don't</b> just give up! </li>	<li><strong>Note the password given to you by the install script.</strong></li>	<li> When finished, the install script should show you a link to the <a href="admin/index.lasso">admin pages</a> for login. Sign in with the username <code>admin</code> and the password generated during the installation. You can then click on 'Users', etc., to change the password.</li>	<li> After installation, it's a good idea to hide <code>/admin/install.lasso</code> from malicious users or remove it completely - though there is some built-in protection in the script against repeated use.</li></ol><h1>Upgrading from older versions</h1><p>If you have an older version  of <strong>LassoBlogger</strong>, first</p><ul>    <li>it's a good idea to back up your blog database first (for exmaple you can duplicate in in the DatabaseBrowser.lassoapp), so you will be able to go back to a previous version in case something goes wrong with the upgrade</li>    <li>remember to back up your old blog files, too - below is one way to do it:</li>    <ul>    <li>move the zip file next to your active blog directory and unpack it</li>    <li>copy your old <code>config.lasso</code> from your active blog directory to the new version</li>    <li>do the same to any other files that you may have customized (customization of the style definitions in <code>gen/frame_default.inc</code> is recommended, customization of <code>themes/default/style.css</code> is *not* recommended, as it may change from version to version)</li>    <li>rename your old blog directory, for example from <code>blog</code> to <code>blog_OLD</code> (you can delete it later, when you are sure you have resqued from it everything you need)</li>    <li>rename the new blog directory (the one you just unzipped) with the original name, for example <code>blog</code> (you should use the same name as before, otherwise your blog's www address will change)</li>    </ul></ul><p>From v0.7.3 up, you can check your LassoBlogger version from the Admin Dashboard page. The version number is stored in the file <code>inc/library.inc</code>, right at the top. </p><p>If you upgrade from <strong>0.5</strong>, run <code>admin/upgrade_05_06.lasso</code> to upgrade to 0.6. Then follow directions below. </p><p>If you upgrade from <strong>0.6</strong>, open the new <code>config_sample.lasso</code>, scroll down, copy the last line (<code>Variable:'start'...</code>) and place it at the bottom of your active copy of <code>config.lasso</code>. Then follow directions below. </p><p>If you upgrade from a version between <strong>0.6</strong> and <strong>0.7.2</strong>, run <code>admin/upgrade_06_073.lasso</code> to upgrade to 0.7.3, then follow directions below.</p><p>If you upgrade from <strong>0.7.3</strong>, run <code>admin/upgrade_073_08.lasso</code> to upgrade to 0.8.0, then follow directions below.</p><p>If you upgrade from <strong>0.8.0b1</strong> (or any older version), you have to copy the variable <code>dbConfig</code> from <code>config_sample.lasso</code> to your active <code>config.lasso</code>. Then follow directions below. </p><p>If you upgrade from <strong>0.9.0</strong>, please run <code>admin/upgrade_090_091.lasso</code>.</p><p>If you upgrade from <strong>0.9.1</strong>, please run <code>admin/upgrade_091_092.lasso</code>.</p><p><b>After running any upgrader scripts, it is a good idea to hide them from malicious users.</b></p><h1 id="requirements">System Recommendations</h1><ul>    <li><strong>Lasso Professional 8</strong> or newer (may work on older version, but is not tested; I have developed this on L6.0.6 until v0.8.0b1; then on L8.5, and now on L9.1.4).</li>	<li><strong>MySQL</strong>; may work on other SQL db's, but is not tested</li></ul><h1>New in 0.9.2 - Lasso 9 compatibility, scale & rotate images</h1><p><b>Now compatible with Lasso 9</b>. Phew, that was a lot of work.</p><p><b>Redesigned admin area</b> with new, faster navigation.</p><p><b>Scale and/or rotate images</b> when uploading.</p><p><b>Better code</b>. Practically all code has been modernized (colons -> parens, to start with), and a lot of refactoring has been done. The footprint is now much smaller. </p><p><b>CKeditor instead of FCKeditor</b> on admin pages.</p><h1>New in 0.9.1 - FCKeditor, and better spam control</h1><p><b>FCKeditor for admin pages.</b> For some instructions, see the <a href="docs/versionhistory.html">Version History</a>.</p><p><b>New spam-filtering feature</b> based on an encrypted timestamp on the commenting form. This feature is built-in and cannot be adjusted by the means of Options.</p><p><b>Image links:</b> possibility to make an uploaded image to work as a link. This can be done on the admin page Uploads > Manage Files. For some instructions, see the <a href="docs/versionhistory.html">Version History</a>.</p><p><b>Uploaded images can now be tied to a post manually, after upload.</b> This can be done on the admin page Uploads > Manage Files.</p><p><b>For bug fixes:</b> See <a href="docs/versionhistory.html">the version history</a>.<h1>New in 0.9.0 - table prefixes, blog by email</h1><p><b>Table prefixes - many apps per single database:</b> a new variable in <code>config.lasso</code> facilitates sharing one single database between several LB blogs or other applications. If for example the table prefix is set to &rdquo;bl1_&rdquo;, the posts table will be stored as <code>bl1_posts</code>, and all other blog tables likewise.</p><p><b>Send articles to your blog via email:</b> if you set up a dedicated email address to your blog, and configure the relevant options, and set up a Lasso event to fetch email from your email server, you can start blogging by sending emails to your blog. Handy when you only have a slow mobile internet connection. For a basic documentation see <a href="docs/lassoblogger_info/blogbyemail.txt">this short article</a>. For a general tutorial see <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Blog_by_Email">this article</a> from the WordPress codex. </p><p><b>Graphical smilies:</b> a small but nice feature. Switchable through Writing Options.</p><p><b>Login/Logout links in the public view:</b> always visible, when the user is not already logged in. </p><p><b>Other features & fixes:</b> See <a href="docs/versionhistory.html">the version history</a>.</p><!--<p><b></b></p>--><h1>New in 0.8 - file uploads and other features</h1><p><b>0.8.0: </b>: A new Quick Delete button on admin page Manage > List Comments. Saves time, in case your blog is ever flooded with spam.</p><p><b>0.8.0: </b>: On admin pages, a warning text will be displayed, if the user tries to delete a non-empty post-category or file-category record.</p><p><b>0.8.0:</b> Post summaries enabled. When there is text in the summary field of a post, in all list views that text will be shown instead of the main text - and a link will be displayed pointing to the whole text of the post. (Switchable via Options since 0.9.0.)</p><p><b>0.8.0b1:</b> Files can now be uploaded from the Admin pages. They can either be tied to invididual posts, or they can belong to "File Vault", a separate file repository. The file <A HREF="docs/lassoblogger_info/uploads.txt">lb_uploads.txt</A> should give a basic orientation to using file uploads. You *have to* read it to get a grip of file uploads!</p><p><b>0.8.0b1:</b> Options have been regrouped, so now the Admin > Option pages should be a little easier to understand.</p><p><b>0.8.0b1:</b> A new option <code>multiuser_blog</code> should provide an easy way to choose between one-author and multi-author blogs - this option is however not activated as of this writing.</p><h1>New in 0.7.3 - comment control</h1><p>Options related to commenting have now been activated. You will find them on the admin page Options &gt; Discussion, except for <code>comment_registration</code>, which for historical reasons is on the page Options &gt; General.  </p><p>Now LassoBlogger should have at least elemental protection against spam comments. For an overview of how to control commenting, see the file <A HREF="docs/lassoblogger_info/commenting_options.txt">lb_commenting_options.txt</A> in the docs.</p><h1>New in 0.7.2</h1><p>Categories can now be sorted (newest-to-oldest, or vice versa). A new field <code>cat_sortorder</code> is created for this purpose by the upgrader script.</p><h1>New in 0.7 - permalink and languages</h1><p>The two big new features are permalinks and language support. </p><p>When using permalinks, links to your post may look like <code>www.MyDomain.org/MyBlog/2005/12/My_Post_Title</code>.</p><p>Permalink structure can be modified by adjusting the related  option (new in this version) on the admin page Options > Permalinks. Permalinks use the "error.lasso method". This required that you put a <strong>modified error.lasso</strong> file to your domain root, where Lasso will use it in case of any errors. </p><p>Check the enclosed <code>error.lasso</code>. you can use it as such, or modify (for example, you could add link to webmaster, or company logo). Then put it to the domain root. </p><p>Of course, you can perfectly well use LassoBlogger without using permalinks. In that case links to your posts look like this: <code>www.MyDomain.org/MyBlog/?p=15</code>.  </p><p>The <strong>language support</strong> works this way: </p><ul>    <li>first try to find out if a language file for your language already exists; take a look to the <code>languages</code> folder; read the official <a href="http://www.greenspot.fi/LassoBlogger/">dev blog</a>; ask the developer    <li>if not, it's easy to do - about 70-80 phrases to translate from English, and they all are in one file; it took me about 30 minutes to do the Finnish translation (it's all in <code>languages/fi.inc</code>)</li>    <li>decide upon a language code (for example de, fr, or en_UK)</li>    <li>open <code>languages/language_template.inc</code> and follow directions in it</li>    <li>finally, activate your translations by changing the value of variable <code>lang</code> from "en" to your chosen code (in <code>config.lasso</code>)</li></ul><p>New in 0.7.0 is also the possibility to create <strong>static pages</strong>.</p><h1>Fighting spam comments</h1><p>From version 0.9.1, the main line of defence is based on an encrypted timestamp on commenting form. If the timestamp is missing, or if it shows that too much time has elapsed since the form was loaded, the comment is discarded.</p><p>From version 0.7.3 there are a number of options available to regulate commenting. </p><p>There are so many options that it's easy to get things mixed up. I recommend the following: </p><ul>    <li>start with all comments allowed (check your discussion options)</li>    <li>read <code>docs/lassoblogger_info/commenting_options.txt</code> to get an overview of available options, so you will be ready to act</li>    <li>if and when you get first spam comments, start tightening the rules; start from the least powerful options. Go as far as needed, until the spam stops but the good comments keep coming</li></ul><h1>Customising the layout</h1><p>The basic stylesheet is <code>themes/default/style.css</code>. For v0.7, I moved style definitions that affect the page header (the top of page, where you see blog name and description) from the stylesheet to the top of the html template, <code>gen/frame_default.inc</code>. You can adjust them to your liking, and on later upgrades be sure to backup and reuse your modified <code>frame_default.inc</code>. I may modify the main stylesheet from version to version, though I try to be conservative about it. </p><p>Of course you can also revamp the stylesheet - that equals creating a new <b>theme</b>, and I'm interested to distribute LB themes. Besides a stylesheet, a theme can also include images. </p><h1>User Levels </h1><p>The admin page "Edit users" helps you grade the levels. The theoretical levels range from 0 to 10, but essentially the relevant levels are:</p><ul>	<li>0 - Can edit his/her own user info</li>	<li>1 - Can post, edit and delete drafts (posts that need administrator approval to get published)</li>	<li>2 - Can post, edit, and delete his/her own posts</li>	<li>5 - May edit links and categories; sees list of users</li>	<li>8 - Admin - may edit options, and edit posts, comments and user info of all users</li>	<li>10 - Max value</li></ul><p>In the usual case you may want a team of level 2 users (writers) to work with you (the administrator). You may also want one or two assistant admins (level 8 would be good for that). </p><h1>Past and future</h1><p>Since May 2009, LassoBlogger code was maintained at Google Code. In April 2012, it was moved to Github.</p> <p>I hope the Github repository would encourage other developers to participate. If you cannot find your favorite feature in LassoBlogger, please code it yourself and submit the results to Github repository &ndash; or make a feature/fix request to me. </p><h1>Support and Documentation</h1><p>Check the <code>docs</code> folder for a rudimentary <A href="docs/versionhistory.html">version history</A> and some tutorials (for example on fighting comment spam, and uploading images). For support, check the <A href="http://www.greenspot.fi/LassoBlogger/">LassoBlogger dev blog</A> first. There you can leave bug reports and ask questions. You can also contact the developer by email - see <A href="http://www.greenspot.fi/LassoBlogger">the dev blog</A> for address.</p><h1>Thanks</h1><p class="small">Thanks to Marc Vos for help in testing & debugging (v0.8.0) and for new ideas.
